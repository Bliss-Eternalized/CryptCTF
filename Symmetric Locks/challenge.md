### "Symmetric Locks"

Cryptography (Medium)

As you proceed out of the crypt, the crypt master reveals themselves once again. As your surroundings become more clear, you realize that this is the work of the overseer. Knowing the code of the prison, now you need to reverse their encryption. The crypt master continues to laugh manically in their den, but you shall best the crypt master again.
