### "What? Three Words?"

GEOSINT (Medium)

The mage in the corner is "organizing frog racks," whatever those three words mean. But, the mage insists that the words mark the location of a ship which can be seen. Call the name of the ship, and you may be allowed to leave, but if you fail in doing so, then you'll be tossed into the sea.

The flag is formatted as `hackUMBC{USS_SHIPNAME}`, where all letters are capitalized and all spaces are replaced with an underscore.
